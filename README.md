# Wireguard MacOS app
For some unknown reasons the developers of [wireguard-apple](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-apple) project did not release .dmg files and the only way of getting
the app is to download it from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209). Yet that requires sign-in
into an Apple account.

After the application is downloaded one can sign out the Apple account and just use it and transfer it to other MacOS devices
by simply moving the app into _Applications_ directory. This repository contains universal (Intel & Apple Silicon compatible) application to save you the hassle.

# Installation
To install it simple download a release, extract the application and put it into global or local _Applications_ directory.
